## What it is

SATURNIX is a DIY retrofuturistic digital camera built on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W with a 16MP autofocus sensor and a small LCD viewfinder.
It shoots RAW+JPG and processes photos on-device using simple JPEG presets inspired by film stocks.
Image capture and processing run entirely on the Raspberry Pi. No external apps are required.

## Why I built it

About a year ago I just wanted a camera that felt good to use — something simple, physical, and that I could tweak however I wanted. I didn't like how modern cameras are designed, and I couldn't find anything open-source that felt right. So I built my own.

I spent a lot of time on how it feels to hold and use, not just on the code.

This isn't trying to replace a real camera. It's more of a personal experiment around:

- simple camera setups
- keeping everything local (no cloud)
- work on creating our own image processing system

**This started as a personal project. After sharing it online and seeing the level of interest, I decided to make it publicly available as open source.**

## Getting Started
The project is still in active development.

- Firmware &  Hardware release coming soon (I hope to publish the project in full within the next two weeks)
- Join Discord for dev updates and early access

## Early prototype (v0)

### This was one of the first working versions — about a year ago.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/prototype_2.jpg" width="500">
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/prototype_3.jpg" width="500">
</p>

This started as a just-for-fun thing. Me and some friends were messing around with cameras and photography, and at some point I thought — why not try to build one from scratch?
This early version was all about getting things to actually work — sensor, buttons, screen, basic controls. It looked rough, felt rough, and that was fine. It was never meant to be pretty. We just wanted to see if it could work at all.
Turns out it could. So I kept going.

## Current state (v1)

### A year later — this is where we ended up

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/1.jpg" width="500"/>
</p>

From a messy pile of wires that barely worked to an actual, usable camera.
The design takes a lot of cues from old 80s–90s electronics — that chunky, slightly industrial look that old gear used to have. I've always liked that aesthetic, so I leaned into it.

## Features

**Camera**
- 16MP autofocus sensor (Arducam IMX519)
- RAW (DNG) + JPG capture
- Full manual controls: Shutter (30s–1/4000), ISO (100–3200), WB, EV
- Autofocus modes: AF-C (continuous with lock), AF-S (single shot), MF (manual)

**JPEG presets (film-inspired)**
- **Saturnix** — custom preset (in develop)
- **S-Gold** — warm, vintage, creamy tones
- **S-Vivid** — higher saturation, stronger contrast, more aggressive sharpening
- **S-Natural** — neutral colors with slight green shift
- **S-MonoX** — black & white with added contrast and grain
- **VHS** — lo-fi effect (scanlines, chromatic aberration, noise)

**Interface**
- 2" LCD live preview at 320×240
- Auto-hide UI (clean viewfinder after 15s)
- Live histogram with exposure traffic light
- Composition grids (Thirds, Golden Ratio, Cross)
- AF indicator with auto-detection
- CPU temperature & storage monitoring
- Persistent settings (survive reboot)

**Connectivity**
- Built-in WiFi hotspot for transferring photos
- Simple web interface (terminal-style)
- Works without internet (direct connection to phone)

**Audio**
- Passive buzzer feedback for all actions
- Customizable: shutter, focus, navigation, startup sounds
- Mute mode

### 3D Printed Case

STL files for the camera case are ~~available~~ in the [`hardware/`](hardware/) directory.
__The case is designed for resin printing (FDM version is being considered)__

## Current limitations

This project is still experimental and has several practical limitations:

### Performance⚠️

- Boot time is relatively long (~1 minute)
- Each photo currently takes ~8–14 seconds to process

The main reason is how the camera pipeline works right now:

- LiveView stops the camera (picamera2.stop + close) — ~1–2s  
- rpicam-still reinitializes the camera from scratch — ~3–5s  
- Capture — ~0.5–2s  
- Saving to SD card — ~1s  
- LiveView starts the camera again — ~3–5s  

Most of the delay comes from restarting the camera twice per shot, not the capture itself.

Performance is expected to improve. Current focus is on reaching a stable release.
_(A planned improvement is switching to picamera2.switch_mode_and_capture_file(), which allows capturing full-resolution images without stopping the camera.
Expected result: ~1.5–2.5s per shot instead of ~8–14s (5–6× faster).)_

### Hardware & Assembly

- Requires soldering (not beginner-friendly yet)
- Current enclosure is designed for resin 3D printing
- Assembly is more complex than a typical DIY project
- Instructions are still in progress

### Project Scope

- Designed as a DIY camera, not a polished consumer product
- Strong focus on making the design simpler and more accessible over time
- Considering an FDM-printable version of the enclosure (not implemented yet)

### Despite these limitations, the camera has been tested in real-world use (including multi-day outdoor trips) and works reliably for still photography.

## UI Design & Architecture:

The user interface is designed to look and feel like an old terminal. I like this aesthetic, and it's also much lighter on the processor and memory, making it easier to develop. Here's roughly how it all works:

- Colors: Solid colors only, no gradients in UI elements. We use amber (255,191,0), white, and black as the primary palette.
- Typography: TTF — we load the DejaVu Sans Bold 14px font using the ImageFont.truetype() method of the Pillow library. **Custom fonts with a reduced number of glyphs are also suitable and will save some memory.**
- Shapes: Rectangles, lines, and polygons — all drawn using the Pillow library's ImageDraw. Circles are intentionally avoided for a more angular/technical aesthetic. No anti-aliasing.
- Animation: Minimal — a blinking autofocus indicator, a dotted reticle during capture, and an animated progress bar. Everything is redrawn frame by frame, so any simple state-driven animation is possible.

**Regarding icons/images: Technically possible (PIL can compose PNG files), but I haven't used them yet—right now, everything is text and geometry. The priority is a lightweight interface, since each frame must be composed with the camera's video stream and transmitted over SPI.
Resolution: 320x240, so essentially every pixel matters.**

The main limitation of the project is the processor: a 2W Pi Zero running at 1 GHz, so the UI rendering time must remain within ~15 ms to maintain an acceptable preview frame rate. The MAIN bottleneck is the limited performance of the Raspberry Pi, so my priority right now is optimizing the process rather than adding new features or improving the interface's visual design.

## What works today

Spent today working on film simulation profiles. Trying to get the color science as close as possible to that classic film look, but it's still very much a work in progress — lots of tweaking ahead.
Also renaming all the filters to avoid any trademark issues: S-Gold, S-Vivid, S-MonoX, S-Natural, and more to come.
